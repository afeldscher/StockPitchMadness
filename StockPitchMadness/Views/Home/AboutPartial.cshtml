    <h2 class="animation-element animate-Zoom">Why Investing is important</h2>
    <p class="aboutContent animation-element animate-Zoom">
        Investment helps corporations raise finance that is much needed for development, taking over competitors, gaining technological
        prowess, and creating employment. These benefits of investment led Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs' CEO, to say, that he and his
        colleagues were “doing God’s work.” That is why teams of (3) students will spend the weekend pitching on why to buy and short stocks
        of their choosing at Drexel University. With this learning experience, the most important aspect of Stock Pitch Madness is the community
        it will generate and the skills that students will walk away with.

    <h2 class="animation-element animate-Zoom">The Stock Pitch Madness Difference</h2>
    <p class="aboutContent animation-element animate-Zoom">
        The goal of Stock Pitch Madness is the help spur a revolution in the way business students develop and showcase
        their skills. Teams of (3) students will apply for one out of the four sectors which are:
        <b>Consumer Retail, Energy, Healthcare, and Technology</b>.
        Teams will then research two stocks within that sector finding one stock to buy and one stock to short.
        The competition will be utilizing the bracket system, which will be broken up into each sector for teams to compete.
        We hope by having this competition that we can help students and companies engage with one another in a unique way, while 
        also providing learning opportunities and workshops throughout the weekend.
