    <h2 class="animation-element animate-Zoom">Why Investing is important</h2>
    <p class="aboutContent animation-element animate-Zoom">
        Investing helps companies raise finance that is much needed for development, taking over competitors, gaining technological prowess,
        and creating employment.  That is why teams of (3) students will spend the weekend pitching two stocks of their choosing at Drexel University.
        With this learning experience, the most important aspect of Stock Pitch Madness is the community it will generate and the skills that students
        will walk away with.

    <h2 class="animation-element animate-Zoom">The Stock Pitch Madness Difference</h2>
    <p class="aboutContent animation-element animate-Zoom">
        The goal of Stock Pitch Madness is to help spur a revolution in the way business students develop and showcase
        their skills. Teams of (3) students will apply for one out of the four sectors which are:
        <b>Consumer Retail, Energy, Healthcare, and Technology</b>.
        Teams will then research two stocks within that sector finding one stock to buy and one stock to short.
        The competition will be utilizing the bracket system, which will be broken up into each sector for teams to compete.
        By having this competition we hope that we can help students and companies engage with one another in a unique way,
        while also providing learning opportunities through our workshops and seminars.
