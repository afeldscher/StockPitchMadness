Stock Pitch Madness is a new, student run event at Drexel University. 

For this project I developed a website to the client's specifications using ASP.NET MVC 5. It was developed in Visual Studio
2015. I also used TypeScript and Less for styling and animations.

I created a data driven design that is highly maintainable; the content sections of the page are loaded from json files. 
I worked with a designer, allowing me to focus on the application design, rather than the visual design. 

This project is still a work in progress.
